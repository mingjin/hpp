h2. What is HPP?

h2. How to Use It?

h3. Requirements

Ruby 1.9.3-p194

h3. Installation

bq. @gem install hpp@

h3. Usage

Go to the directory where the original HTML file folder sits.

<pre>
project
 |-src
   |-x.html
   |-_y.html
   |-css
     |-main.css
   |-js
     |-site.js
</pre>

Assume x.html includes _y.html, such as the directive <!--#include file='_y.html'-->

Invoking the command under project directory, just like bellow

bq. @project> hpp process src target@

It will create another folder 'target', and 'tree target' will return:

<pre>
project
 |-src
   |-x.html
   |-_y.html
   |-css
     |-main.css
   |-js
     |-site.js
 |-target
   |-x.html
   |-css
     |-main.css
   |-js
     |-site.js
</pre>

Note: the content of _y.html will be included into x.html at the place where the above <include> directive is.

h2. Command Options

hpp process [source folder] [target folder]

* If [source folder] not specified, the 'src' folder will be assumed by default. If there doesn't exist the expected [source folder], RuntimeError will be raised.
